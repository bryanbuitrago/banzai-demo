## 📈 Key Marketing Metrics

Understanding key performance metrics is crucial for optimizing marketing campaigns. Below are the core metrics used in this dashboard:

### 1️⃣ Clicks

🔹 **Definition:** The number of times users click on an ad, email link, or marketing campaign link.  
🔹 **Why It Matters:** Indicates how many people are engaging with the ad.

**Example:**  
A company runs a LinkedIn ad for a webinar:

- **Impressions:** 1,000 people see the ad.
- **Clicks:** 100 people click on it.

**Click-Through Rate (CTR) Formula:**

```
CTR = (Clicks / Impressions) × 100
```

**CTR Calculation:**

```
CTR = (100 / 1000) × 100 = 10%
```

---

### 2️⃣ Spend

🔹 **Definition:** The total amount of money spent on an ad campaign.  
🔹 **Why It Matters:** Helps businesses track costs and determine ROI.

**Example:**

- A company spends **$500** on Facebook ads.
- The ad gets **250 clicks**.

**Cost Per Click (CPC) Formula:**

```
CPC = Spend / Clicks
```

**CPC Calculation:**

```
CPC = 500 / 250 = $2.00 per click
```

---

### 3️⃣ Conversions

🔹 **Definition:** The number of users who take a desired action after clicking the ad (e.g., signing up, making a purchase, booking a demo).  
🔹 **Why It Matters:** Conversions measure real business results, not just engagement.

**Example:**

- From **250 clicks**, **20 users** sign up for a free trial.

**Conversion Rate (CR) Formula:**

```
CR = (Conversions / Clicks) × 100
```

**CR Calculation:**

```
CR = (20 / 250) × 100 = 8%
```

### 🎯 Bonus: How These Metrics Relate to ROI (Return on Investment)

Marketers need to evaluate whether their ad spend is generating revenue.

**ROI Formula:**

```
ROI = ((Revenue from Conversions - Spend) / Spend) × 100
```

**Example:**

- The company spends **$500** on ads.
- The campaign generates **$2,000** in sales.

**ROI Calculation:**

```
ROI = ((2000 - 500) / 500) × 100 = 300%
```

🔹 **A positive ROI (100%+) means the campaign is profitable.**  
🔹 **A negative ROI means the company is losing money.**
